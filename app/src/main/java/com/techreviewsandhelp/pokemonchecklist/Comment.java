         It turns out I can't use images of the actual Pokemon due to copyright reasons.
     Anyone reading this, if you have a solution to this, then I will listen.

     I'm thinking of having the main checklist shorted by game type or generation. That away people
     can just select the check boxed from a dropdown menu.

     I'm thinking once the checklist and dropbox sync gets done. I will just release the app. But I
     will keep asking for help to improve and add extra features into it.
